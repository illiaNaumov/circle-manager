# Circle manager

## How to run
Code of Circle Manager could be executed from IntelliJ IDEA or from console.
```Solution.kt``` is an entry point

## Explanation
My Circle manager implementation stores circles and members in cache key-value map.
It gives clear API for managing circles and members.
Also, there some utility methods for operating with circles e.g. filtering unique circles or counting duplicated circles

## Further improvements
It would be nice to implement functionality for finding the closest member of one of the circles.
Also, code should be covered with more tests, especially ```CircleManager.kt```
